              <p className='text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed'>
                Walking through Shilin Night Market on a humid Tuesday evening,
                I started wondering: whose Taiwan is being sold here? The
                vendors switching between Taiwanese (Traditional Chinese) and
                broken English depending on their customers made me think about
                Yu-Jen Chen's work on how the government picks and chooses which
                foods get to represent "authentic" Taiwan.
              </p>
              <p className='text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed'>
                What struck me most was how these night markets operate as
                complex spaces where official cultural narratives collide with
                everyday practices. You have vendors selling "traditional
                Taiwanese" food to tourists while also serving completely
                different dishes to local families. It made me wonder how
                digital tools might capture these multiple layers of meaning,
                following Srinivasan and Luther's ideas about community-driven
                heritage.

                  Chen's analysis of state-promoted cuisine is fascinating, but
                  what does it look like on the ground? I noticed Hakka dishes
                  getting completely different treatment than Indigenous foods.
                  Why do some vendors proudly display their Hakka heritage while
                  others don't even mention it?

                  I keep thinking about who gets to tell these food stories
                  online. Most museum digital collections are still pretty
                  top-down, but what if vendors could share their own family
                  histories? Would that change how I understand "authentic"
                  Taiwanese food?

                  This is probably the most complicated question. Watching
                  vendors perform "Taiwaneseness" for tourists made me
                  uncomfortable at first, but then I realized it's far more
                  complex. Are they selling out, or are they cleverly adapting
                  traditions for survival?

                  Wu and Lin call night markets "democratic cultural spaces,"
                  but I want to push that idea further. Sure, anyone can afford
                  a $2 bowl of noodles, but whose cultural narratives actually
                  get heard in these spaces?

                Using food studies and postcolonial theory to make sense of what

                analysis.

          </h2>
          <p className='text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed'>
            I'm drawing heavily on Yu-Jen Chen's work on ethnic politics in
            Taiwan's national cuisine, which helped me understand why certain
            foods get promoted while others remain invisible. Her analysis of
            state banquets was particularly useful for thinking about how food
            becomes a tool for identity-making at the national level.

          <p className='text-neutral-300 mb-6 leading-relaxed'>
            Srinivasan and Luther's ideas about democratic digital heritage have
            been crucial for thinking about this project's goals. Their critique
            of traditional museum cataloging made me realize how much gets lost
            when cultural institutions control the narrative. That's partly why
            I wanted to experiment with more open-ended digital documentation.
          </p>
          <p className='text-neutral-300 leading-relaxed'>
            I'm also influenced by broader work in food studies and postcolonial
            analysis, though I'm still working through how to apply some of
            these frameworks to Taiwan's specific historical context. The
            relationship between mainland Chinese, Taiwanese, and Indigenous
            food cultures is far more complex than I initially realized.
