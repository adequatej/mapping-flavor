# Mapping Flavor: Taiwan Night Markets Cultural Research

**A Critical Examination of Taiwanese Cultural Identity Through Night Market Food Culture**

## üìñ Overview

This digital humanities project investigates how Taiwan's night markets function as sites of cultural identity negotiation. Through observational research and critical cultural analysis, this study explores how food vendors navigate authenticity, tourism pressures, and cultural preservation in post-colonial Taiwan.

## üî¨ Research Framework

### Central Research Questions

1. **Cultural Authenticity**: How do vendors balance preserving "authentic" Taiwanese flavors with adapting to tourism demands?
2. **Identity Politics**: Which foods get promoted as "authentically Taiwanese" and whose cultural narratives remain marginalized?
3. **Democratic Heritage**: How can digital tools democratize cultural documentation and amplify community voices?
4. **Postcolonial Context**: How do night markets function as sites of cultural resistance and adaptation?

### Methodology

- **Observational Research**: Direct documentation of vendor-customer interactions and cultural performances
- **Photo Documentation**: Visual evidence of spatial organization and cultural markers
- **Critical Analysis**: Application of food studies theory, postcolonial analysis, and digital heritage scholarship
